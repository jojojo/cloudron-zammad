# variables to the ones expected by the official Zammad docker-entrypoint,
# prepares the few writable runtime paths needed under Cloudron's read-only
# filesystem, runs the (idempotent) zammad-init step synchronously, then hands
# off to supervisord which runs the long-running processes as the non-root
# "zammad" user (uid/gid 1000, baked into the upstream image).
