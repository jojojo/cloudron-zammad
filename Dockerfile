# Only supervisor is added on top of the official image: it orchestrates the
# railsserver/websocket/scheduler/nginx processes exposed by the upstream
# docker-entrypoint. Memcached is intentionally NOT installed: without
# MEMCACHE_SERVERS, Zammad's own config/application.rb cleanly falls back to a
# file-based cache store, so it is not required to run correctly.

# Cloudron containers run with a read-only root filesystem at runtime; only
# /tmp, /run and /app/data are writable. Zammad's tmp/ directory (Rails cache,
# pidfiles, sockets, the autowizard payload) is baked into the image layers and
# doesn't need to survive restarts, so redirect it to /run instead.
RUN rm -rf /opt/zammad/tmp && ln -s /run/zammad-tmp /opt/zammad/tmp

# Zammad defaults to storing attachments in PostgreSQL (Setting "storage_provider"
# = "DB"), so this path is unused in normal operation. It only matters if an
# admin later switches the storage provider to "Filesystem": in that case files
# must land on Cloudron's persistent, backed-up /app/data volume rather than the
# read-only image layer, so replace the baked-in directory with a symlink here
# (it cannot be created at runtime since /opt/zammad is read-only).

# nginx (bundled in the base image) is compiled with default temp paths under
# /var/lib/nginx, which is also read-only at runtime on Cloudron. Redirect them
# to /run/nginx/* (created and chowned in start.sh).

# The zammad-nginx entrypoint step writes a generated resolver.conf into
